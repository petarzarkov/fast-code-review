/**
 * Local oxlint JS plugin. oxlint has no `no-restricted-syntax` and no built-in
 * enum rule, so the repo's enum ban is enforced here.
 *
 * **JavaScript, not TypeScript, and that is deliberate.** oxlint loads a JS
 * plugin by spawning **Node**, not Bun - so a `.ts` file here fails with
 * `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` on any Node without type stripping (below 22.18).
 * That broke the pre-commit hook for anyone whose default `node` was older, and
 * made CI depend on which Node the runner image happened to ship. A `.js` file
 * loads on every Node there is.
 *
 * The types it had were three hand-written interfaces with no imports -
 * `oxlint/plugins-dev` is alpha and exports only a placeholder - so they cost
 * nothing to express as JSDoc, and `@ts-check` still checks them.
 *
 * @typedef {{ readonly type: string, readonly name?: string }} AstNode
 * @typedef {{ report(descriptor: { node: AstNode, message: string }): void }} RuleContext
 * @typedef {{ readonly create: (context: RuleContext) => Record<string, (node: AstNode) => void> }} RuleModule
